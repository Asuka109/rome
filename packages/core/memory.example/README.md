# Memory System

The memory directory is the agent's persistent, git-tracked knowledge store. It allows the agent to maintain continuity across sessions and remember information about the guardian and their relationships.

## Directory Structure

```
memory/
├── README.md                         # This file
├── MEMORY.md                         # Always-loaded index: frequently-used facts + pointers + privacy config
├── IDENTITY.md                       # Agent identity (name, personality, purpose)

## How Memory Files Are Used

The agent reads memory files at the start of each session to build context:

1. **MEMORY.md** is loaded first and in full, so it is kept lean: only frequently-used facts inline, plus a one-line pointer to each topic file. Its privacy config determines what the agent is forbidden from storing. Key facts and preferences provide session continuity.
2. **IDENTITY.md** defines the agent's personality and communication style.
3. **GUARDIAN.md** provides the guardian's profile, timezone, and communication preferences.
4. **BONDS.md** tells the agent who people are and how much to remember about them based on their tier.
5. **Topic files** (`topics/<topic>.md`) hold the durable, per-subject knowledge that MEMORY.md only points to. They are loaded on-demand when the agent works on that subject, so they can hold more than MEMORY.md.
6. **Project summaries** (`projects/<project-name>/PROJECT.md`) contribute their first paragraph to the main agent's always-loaded context. The rest of each file is for deeper reference and maintenance.
7. **Person profiles** (`<person-id>.md`) are loaded on-demand when the agent interacts with or discusses a specific person.
8. **Journal entries** hold details and events, loaded on-demand for recent context (e.g., the last few days). Durable takeaways are distilled up into a topic file or MEMORY.md.

### Memory Writing Flow

1. The agent decides something should be remembered (based on skill instructions or conversation context).
2. Checks `MEMORY.md` privacy config — skips if the topic is blocked.
3. Checks `BONDS.md` to determine how much to remember for a person's tier.
4. Writes to the appropriate file: details and events to the journal, per-subject knowledge to a topic file (with a one-line pointer in `MEMORY.md`), a person to their profile. Only frequently-used facts go inline in `MEMORY.md`.
5. Git commits the change with a descriptive message.

## How the Guardian Can Edit Memory

The guardian has full control over all memory files:

- **Web UI**: Browse, edit, and save memory files through the `/memory` page with a markdown editor and live preview.
- **Direct editing**: Memory files are plain markdown — edit them with any text editor, IDE, or from the command line.
- **Git history**: All changes (by the agent or the guardian) are git-committed, so you can always review the history or revert changes.

Common things the guardian might want to edit:
- Add privacy restrictions in `MEMORY.md`
- Correct facts or preferences the agent got wrong
- Add or update project summaries in `projects/`
- Promote or demote people between relationship tiers in `BONDS.md`
- Add or update person profiles in `relationship/`
- Update their own profile in `GUARDIAN.md`

## Auditability

All memory changes are tracked in git:
- Every write by the agent creates a git commit with a descriptive message.
- The guardian can review the git log for any file to see what changed and when.
- Changes can be reverted using standard git operations.
- The web UI provides a history view for each file.

## File Formats

### Topic File (`memory/topics/<topic>.md`)

One file per subject the guardian cares about. Holds the full, durable knowledge of that topic; `MEMORY.md` keeps only a one-line pointer to it. See `topics/README.md` for conventions and the recommended format. The `<topic>` is a URL-safe slug (e.g., `health.md`).

### Journal Entry (`memory/journal/yyyy/mm/dd.md`)

One file per day. Sections for key events, interactions, notes, and reminders.

```markdown
# Journal — YYYY-MM-DD

## Key Events
- Description of notable events from the day.

## Interactions
- **Person Name**: Summary of interaction.

## Notes
- Observations, thoughts, or context worth preserving.

## Reminders
- Things to follow up on or remember for upcoming days.
```

### Person Profile (`memory/relationship/<person-id>.md`)

One file per known person. See `TEMPLATE.md` in the relationship directory for the full format. The `person-id` is a URL-safe slug derived from the person's name (e.g., `john-doe.md`).

### Project Summary (`memory/projects/<project-name>/PROJECT.md`)

Each project under `~/.rome/<profile>/projects/<project-name>` can have a matching memory folder at `memory/projects/<project-name>/`.

- The first paragraph must be a high-level description of the project. This paragraph is always loaded into the main agent's context.
- The rest of the file can capture deeper notes such as repo structure, conventions, current priorities, important commands, and known pitfalls.
- Sync with `~/.rome/<profile>/projects` is best effort. Rome does not scan that directory and does not create these summaries automatically; agents and the guardian maintain them over time.

Recommended format:

```markdown
# Project Name

Short high-level description of what this project is and why it exists.

## Structure
- apps/web
- packages/core

## Current Priorities
- Finish auth migration
- Remove legacy job runner
```
