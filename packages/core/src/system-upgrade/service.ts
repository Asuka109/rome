// Upgrade probe and cutover owner. Process model: docs/architecture/process.md.
//
// `checkAndOffer()` is the body of the nightly `system_upgrade` action: it asks
// Rome Cloud whether a release is pending and,
// if so, opens the consent countdown on the UpgradeStatusHub. The cutover is the
// same service relaying the apply request to Rome Cloud, reached two ways: a
// guardian's `requestNow()` (awaited, so the route can ack "restart initiated"
// or surface the failure) and the hub's deadline elapsing (consent-by-silence).
// Both funnel through one guarded relay; the hub phase moves only on the
// relay's outcome — `updating` after Rome Cloud accepts, unchanged (button path)
// or back to idle (deadline path) when it doesn't.
