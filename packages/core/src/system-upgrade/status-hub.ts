// Server-authoritative upgrade consent state. Process model: docs/architecture/process.md.
//
// The hub owns the phase (`idle → countdown → updating`) and the countdown
// deadline. The deadline is authoritative *here*, not on any dashboard: when it
// elapses the hub invokes `onDeadline` on its own, so consent-by-silence holds
// even with no dashboard open. Dashboards read state exclusively by polling
// `GET /api/system/upgrade/status/snapshot`; the verbs are `POST .../now` and
// `.../defer`. There is no push channel — a restart severs any stream mid-
// cutover anyway, so polling is the whole read contract.
//
// `updating` is terminal by design: it is entered only after Rome Cloud has
// accepted the cutover, meaning this process is scheduled for replacement.
// Nothing un-sets it — the replacement process boots a fresh hub in `idle`,
// which is what a polling dashboard eventually observes. Until the process
// dies, `updating` tells late pollers "don't trust my idle-looking silence,
// a restart is in flight".
