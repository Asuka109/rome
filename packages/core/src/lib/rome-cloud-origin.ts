/**
 * Parse a loopback callback origin, rejecting anything that is not one.
 *
 * This is a fail-closed guard against a malformed value, not a security
 * boundary — the environment is trusted configuration here, and anyone able to
 * set this can also set `PANTHEON_BASE_ORIGIN`. It exists because the value
 * becomes the `redirect_uri` of an OAuth flow, where a typo does not fail
 * loudly: it silently sends the browser somewhere that cannot answer.
 *
 * An explicit port is required. `URL.origin` drops an absent port, so
 * `http://127.0.0.1` would resolve to port 80 — a dead end that looks exactly
 * like the bug this variable fixes. Port `0` is rejected for the same reason:
 * it means "any free port" to the OS and cannot be dialled.
 *
 * A written-out `http://127.0.0.1:80` is rejected too, because `URL` normalizes
 * the scheme's default port away and leaves `port` empty. That is acceptable
 * rather than correct: the proxy this points at binds well above 1024, and
 * listening on 80 needs root, so the case cannot arise. Parsing the raw string
 * to tell the two apart would buy nothing.
 *
 * `URL.origin` also drops path, query and fragment, which is the right reading
 * of a value named for an origin. Credentials are rejected rather than dropped:
 * they are never part of a callback origin, so their presence means the value
 * was built wrong.
 *
 * It stays separate from {@link getConfiguredInstanceOrigin} on purpose. This
 * says only "where a loopback OAuth callback reaches me", not "my public
 * address". The configured origin also feeds the agent prompt and the Favors
 * `return_to`, and Rome Cloud drops any `return_to` host outside
 * `PANTHEON_DOMAIN` — which a loopback address is.
