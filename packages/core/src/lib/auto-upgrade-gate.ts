 *
 * Keyed on the instance slug; an indeterminate result (no slug, backend
 * unconfigured/unreachable) fails closed — no slug, no auto-upgrade. A
 * `FEATURE_GATE_AUTO_UPGRADE` env override (see @rome-os/libs/feature-flags/env-overrides)
 * is honored inside `checkGate` as the break-glass / no-Statsig knob.
 *
 * This gates only the *automatic* path; the manual settings-page upgrade
 * (`GET /api/system/upgrade/check` + `POST /api/system/upgrade`) is unaffected.
