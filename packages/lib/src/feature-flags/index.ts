/**
 * Vendor-neutral feature-flag access, shared across core.
 *
 * A *gate* is a named boolean rollout decision evaluated for a *unit id* — the
 * rollout key, e.g. a user, instance, or tenant id. Backends **fail closed**: a
 * gate that cannot be evaluated reads `false`, so an unconfigured or unreachable
 * backend disables features rather than enabling them by accident.
 *
 * The active backend is process-global. `initStatsig` installs the real one at
 * boot (see ./statsig.ts); tests install a fake (see ./testing.ts). Callers only
 * ever touch `checkGate` and never see which backend is wired — so this module
 * holds no vendor or feature-specific logic (cloud-auth lives in
 * `../cloud-auth-gate.ts`, which is just one caller).
