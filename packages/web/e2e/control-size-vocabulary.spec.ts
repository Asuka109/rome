/**
 * The Control role's central promise, measured: two members given the same size
 * name are the same height, so a row of them needs no per-call-site nudging.
 * `sm` and `md` are the steps that promise applies to — every member carries
 * them. `lg` and `xs` are the Button family's own, for a standalone call to
 * action and a chip beside body text, and no field implements either.
 *
 * The kit's unit tests pin which `--control-h-*` token each member resolves
 * through, which is the half jsdom can see. This is the other half — the token
 * has to arrive from the host's `:root` and survive the cascade, and only a
 * real browser resolves that. A member that reads the right token and still
 * renders the wrong height fails here and nowhere else.
 *
 * `/dev/gallery` is the page that renders every primitive at every size, so
 * the sweep needs no fixture of its own.
