/**
 * `.touch-target` (in `@rome-os/ui/styles.css`) raises a control to the 44px
 * touch floor where the device has no pointer. Its behavior is decided
 * entirely by the cascade — which half sits in `@layer base` and which is
 * unlayered — so nothing short of a real browser can check it: jsdom resolves
 * neither layers nor layout, and the class strings are identical either way.
 *
 * The competing utilities are injected rather than written as Tailwind
 * classes. Tailwind only compiles what it finds in scanned source, so a class
 * this page happens not to use is absent from the CSS entirely — the probe
 * then measures an unstyled element and the case passes for the wrong reason.
 * Each stand-in is declared in `@layer utilities`, which is where Tailwind
 * emits the real ones, so the layering under test is the real layering.
 *
 * Every case measures a baseline without `.touch-target` first. That is what
 * separates "the contract broke" from "the fixture is dead".
