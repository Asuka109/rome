/**
 * `show_app` — place an available app's widget on the guardian's workspace.
 *
 * The generic, app-agnostic form of a widget placement: the caller names which
 * `appId` to mount (an installed app or a host-owned app such as Sessions), and
 * optionally which `route` + scalar `params` to address. The app's web surface
 * appears as a tile on the freegrid beside the chat.
 *
 * Fire-and-forget: it returns `place_widget`, which the webchat drain loop turns
 * into a transient `widget_placement` event WITHOUT parking the agent (the turn
 * continues). The placement is keyed by `appId`, so calling again retargets the
 * same tile to the new route/params rather than stacking duplicates.
 *
 * Read-only and ungated by design — any agent granted this action can place any
 * installed app. The only enforced check is downstream: the drain loop drops the
 * placement (fail-closed) if `appId` is not actually installed.
 *
 * `route` is the app's own route (it rides the src path → `bootstrap.routePath`).
 * `params` are *addressing* (query keys read off `window.location.search`), not a
 * data payload. Structured data belongs in the target app's own session storage,
 * which the route reads on mount keyed by `session` + `params`.
