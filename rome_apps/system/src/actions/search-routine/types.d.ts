/**
 * search_routine — Find existing routines by a free-text description.
 *
 * Agent-callable, read-only. The agent uses this to identify which routine(s)
 * a user means before editing or deleting one. Matching is deliberately
 * lenient (any meaningful query token hitting the routine's name, action or
 * args) and ranked by how many tokens matched. The schedule is NOT matched —
 * each result carries its schedule so the agent filters by time itself (e.g.
 * "the morning one") and, when several routines match, asks the user which one
 * to act on.
 *
 * An empty query returns every routine.
 *
 * @example
 * // User: "stop reminding me to drink water in the morning"
 * // Search on content terms only; the time ("morning") is the agent's to
 * // resolve against each result's schedule.
 * await callAction("search_routine", { query: "drink water" });
 * // → { totalRoutines: 4, matches: [{ id, name, schedule: "recurring (FREQ=DAILY) at 08:00 ...", ... }] }
