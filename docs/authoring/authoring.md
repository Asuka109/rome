# Authoring Guidelines

An **authoring guideline** is the rulebook for one content type — a doc family, PR descriptions, GitHub issues. It fixes three things: the format of an entry, the bar content must clear to get in, and the conditions under which content leaves. Unlike [WRITING.md](WRITING.md), which shapes how prose reads, an authoring guideline governs what content may exist in the family at all. [ui-primitive-tokens.md](ui-primitive-tokens.md) is the worked example — the authoring guideline for the primitive token docs.

This file is the rulebook for authoring guidelines themselves. Every rule here applies to this file too. The prose in an authoring guideline follows [WRITING.md](WRITING.md), like every other doc.

## Naming

Every authoring guideline lives in this directory as a kebab-case file named for the content type it governs (`prs.md`, `github-issues.md`, `ui-primitive-tokens.md`). ALL-CAPS files in this directory (WRITING.md) are cross-cutting writing rules, not per-type guidelines. `[mech]`

A **family umbrella** is the third kind: one rulebook holding what several per-type guidelines in one family share, named for the family rather than a content type ([ui-tokens.md](ui-tokens.md), shared by the three token-doc guidelines). An umbrella enters only when three or more per-type guidelines already defer to it, and each of them names it as winning where a rule conflicts. `[human]`

## When a content type earns an authoring guideline

Write an authoring guideline for a family only when both hold: `[human]`

1. The family has three or more files, or a concrete plan to reach that.
2. Inconsistency across the family has caused at least one real miss — a wrong edit, a failed lookup, a rule applied in one file but not another. The authoring guideline names that miss.

Until then, the family's rules stay as a section in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md). An authoring guideline written before the family needs one is speculation. Reject it.

## Required sections

Every per-type authoring guideline contains these four sections. It may add sections. It may not omit any of the four. A family umbrella carries **Intake** plus the sections its family shares, because the per-type guidelines below it hold the format, admission, and eviction for their own content. `[mech]`

- **Format** — the structure of one entry or file: required parts, naming, ordering.
- **Admission** — the bar content must clear to enter the family.
- **Eviction** — the condition under which existing content leaves. Default: content that stops clearing the admission bar leaves. Nothing stays for safety.
- **Intake** — the routing rule for recurring feedback: a correction that recurs either becomes an entry, or the maintainer rejects it in writing and states the reason. Silent recurrence means the doc is dead.

## Every rule is checkable

Each rule in an authoring guideline carries one of three tier tags. The tags are the contract with tooling: `[mech]` rules get lint scripts, `[llm]` rules get an automated audit pass, and both skip `[human]` rules. `[mech]`

- `[mech]` — a script can decide pass/fail. Examples: the file contains every required section, file names match a pattern, internal links resolve, the file uses no listed word.
- `[llm]` — deciding takes judgment, but the rule states a decision procedure and includes one passing and one failing example. The example pair is the auditor's test fixture. A judgment rule without the pair fails admission. The "Prefer / Over" blocks in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) are the house format.
- `[human]` — only a person can decide (e.g. "this changed a real decision"). Auditors skip these. They never guess.

A rule that fits no tier is an opinion, not a rule. Reject it.

## Evolution

This doc and every authoring guideline evolve by their own intake rule. A recurring authoring mistake either becomes a rule with a tier tag, or the maintainer rejects it in writing. A rule leaves when the mistake it guards against stops happening — a rule everyone already follows pays audit cost for nothing. `[human]`
