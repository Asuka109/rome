# Emit a DNS-label-safe slug for the current git worktree.

# Rule (Worktree Isolation): the current git branch name,
# lowercased, non-[a-z0-9] runs collapsed to a single hyphen, leading and
# trailing hyphens stripped, truncated to 63 chars. The branch is the stable
# per-worktree identity; the worktree-root basename is the fallback for a
# detached HEAD (no branch to name the stack after).
#
# Consumers:
#   - scripts/dev-up.sh  → Compose project name + Traefik subdomain.
#   - ./r                → locates the running Rome container.
# Keep the output identical across callers.
set -euo pipefail

# `--show-current` is empty on a detached HEAD; fall back to the worktree dir.
